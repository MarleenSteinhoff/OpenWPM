# This script automates the creation and installation
# of the conda environmnet. It's useful for working
# in the docker file and on travis, but it's not
# necessary for individual users to use it.

# Developers are encouraged to only run scripts
# that they fully understand, and may prefer to
# run aspects of this script manually to set-up
# openwpm.

# This script will remove an existing openwpm
# conda environment if it exists.

# Arguments:
# --skip-create: Doesn't change the openwpm conda environment
